## Abstract

This work proposes a new view of the Hashimoto disease related with other diseases. The objective is to explore the association of the Hashimoto disorder with other diseases. Hence, the presence of h pylori bacteria, inappropriate diet, foreign objects inserted on the body like breast implants etc. Topic modeling is a machine learning technic that uses a text-mining tool that helps to correlated words with topics easily making the research process. Accordingly, we used the technique mentioned before for this project about Hashimoto diseases with the purpose to get a better understanding of the disorder and the relationship that this has with other health issues along with the causes and effect that can have on the human body. We collect the data from silo breaker software, which contains data about news, reports, tweets, and blogs.

## 1. Introduction

Hashimoto thyroiditis is an organ-specific autoimmune disorder named after Japanese physician Hajaru Hashimoto. Hashimoto symptoms were first described 1912 but the disease was not recognized until 1957, before that year it was considered to be the early symptoms of Reidel's Thyroiditis. In 1957 Hashimoto was recognized as an autoimmune disorder that destroys thyroid cells and is antibody-mediated. Pathologically speaking, Hashimoto stimulates the formation of antithyroid antibodies that attack the thyroid tissue, causing progressive fibrosis. Hashimoto is believe to be the concequence of a combination of mutated genes and eviromental factors. The disorder is difficult to diagnose since in the early course of the disease the patients may or may not exhibit symptoms and/or laboratory findings of hyperthyroidism or normal values because the destruction of the gland cells may be intermittent. Clinical and epidemiological studies suggest worldwide that the most common cause of hypothyroidism is an inadequate dietary intake of iodine and is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in developed countries.

In a female-to-men radio at least 10:1 women are more often affected than men, and the diagnostics are called between the ages of 30 to 50 years. Studies suggest that an association between high levels of thyroid autoantibodies affect the increased frequencies of mood disorders and there was found a relation between thyroid autoimmunity disease, celiac disease and panic disorder and major depressive disorder.

Due to the arduous labor to identify this disorder a Machine Learning algorithm based on prediction from the early symptoms would be help Doctors to identify Hashimoto in early stages as well as any other health issues related to it like H pylori or inadequate diets this will be helpful for patients that would be able to get the correct treatment in an early stage of the illness avoiding future complications. Also a data research algorithm dedicated to find patient testimonies of improvements or even completed healed and how were these improvements obtained. 

Here comes a convincing introduction to the problem:
Hashimoto autoimmune diseases have been linked to the infection caused by H pylori bacteria. H pylori is until the date the most common chronic bacterial infection, Affecting half of the world's population and is known for the presence of Caga antigens which are virulents strains that have been found in organ and non organ specific autoimmune diseases. Another important trigger of hashimoto disorder is the inadequate modern diet patterns and the environmental factors that are closely related to it. For instance certain food consumption are an essential factor that trigs the disorder since The majority food being consumed is highly preserved and the consumption of artificial flavorings and sugars have dramatically increase in the past years, adding to it the use of chemicals and insecticides in the fruits and vegetables and the massive introduction of hormones for the meat production, all this can be the cause of the rise of autoimmune diseases.

## 5. Datasets

Datasets can be huge and GitHub has limited space. Only very small datasets should be stored in GitHub.
However, if the data is publicly available you program must contain a download function instead that you customize.
Write it using pythons `request`. You will get point deductions if you check-in data sets that are large and do not use
the download function.

## 6. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 6. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 8. Acknowledgments

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.

## 9. References

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
the first square bracket.
